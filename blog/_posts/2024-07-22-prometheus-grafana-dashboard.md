I was hired at one of my past jobs for primarily one reason, to create a monitoring solution to replace their current system. Being familiar with Kubernetes, Prometheus and Grafana, I decided to put together a monitoring solution using (among others), these three components!

Below is the architecture diagram of what I designed and implemented, (albeit slightly modified for removal of intellectual property).
